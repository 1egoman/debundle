In order to troubleshoot, I need:

- A bundle that doesn't work, preferably as minimal as possible. Upload it to pastebin.com:

Link: 

- Any commands you ran prior to debundling:

```
# commands here
```

- Your configuration that you passed with the `-c` argument when debundling.

```
# put the contents of your debundle.config.json here
```

- The **EXACT** command you ran to debundle.

`debundle -i ... -o ... -c ...`

- Tell me what the issue is:

If you omit any of these parts, I can't help you!
